Manual Example
=======

This example utilizes libpng to render a set of PNG images on screen from the /3ds/3dsdod/manual directory.
You can copy the existing images in the gfx directory into that location to render them.
Controls:
- D-Pad Down - Scroll down
- D-Pad Up - Scroll up
- L Trigger - Go to the previous page
- R Trigger - Go to the next page
- Start - Exit the homebrew

Additional Notes:
- The 3DS only supports a max texture size of 1024x1024 so you need to resize any files larger than that.
