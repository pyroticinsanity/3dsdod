Scene Swap Example
=======

This example swaps between drawing a triangle with Citro2D and rendering an image from romfs.
Controls:
- A - Swap between drawing a triangle to an image
- Start - Exit the homebrew

Additional Notes:
- The 3DS only supports a max texture size of 1024x1024 so you need to resize any files larger than that.
