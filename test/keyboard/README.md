Keyboard Example
=======

This example is based off of the 24-bit bitmap example to convert a PNG image of the TRS-80 keyboard to a T3X file and control the key to be pressed.
Controls:
- D-Pad Down - Move down to the next keyboard row or to the top if on the last row
- D-Pad Up - Move up to the next keyboard row or to the bottom if on the first row
- D-Pad Left - Move to the key to the left or to the end if on the first key
- D-Pad Right - Move to the key to the right or to the first if on the last key
- Start - Exit the homebrew

Additional Notes:
- This only handles the keys that are valid for Dungeons of Daggorath and doesn't use all of them.
