PNG Viewer Example
=======

This example utilizes libpng to render a single PNG image on screen from /3ds/3dsdod/manual/dod01.png.
You can copy the existing image in the gfx directory into that location to render it.
Controls:
- D-Pad Down - Scroll down
- D-Pad Up - Scroll up
- Start - Exit the homebrew

Additional Notes:
- The 3DS only supports a max texture size of 1024x1024 so you need to resize any files larger than that.
