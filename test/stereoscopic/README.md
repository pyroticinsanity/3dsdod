Stereoscopic Example
=======

This example builds off of the line_renderer example to display the wizard in 3D using the stereoscopic feature. The controls allow you to tweak the difference between rendering the left and right image to see what the effect is.
Controls:
- A Button - Increases the x offset
- B Button - Decrease the x offset
- X Button - Increase the y offset
- Y Button - Decrease the y offset
- Start - Exit the homebrew
