Alright so this is my project which I would consider to be in Beta format.  
I was going to submit it to the Winter coding competition for retroemu.com but 
sadly that was cancelled.

For those of you that don't know, Dungeons of Daggorath is a wicked "3D" dungeon 
crawler from 1982 for the TRS-80.  It was fun to play and I still can't believe 
that the PSP struggles trying to emulate this computer with a 0.89MHz processor 
and 16K of RAM.

So how do you play a game that was originally text based? With an awesome UI created 
by yours truly! At the moment, every command is executable so there should be no problems
beating the game (Although I haven't done this yet....).

Here's the current button mapping:

PSP		TRS-80
----------------------
UP: 		MOVE
DOWN: 		MOVE BACKWARD
LEFT:		TURN LEFT
RIGHT:		TURN RIGHT
X:		ATTACK RIGHT
SQUARE:		ATTACK LEFT
CIRCLE:		Brings up the keyboard
TRIANGLE:	EXAMINE / LOOK (depending on what mode you're in)
L TRIGGER:	Brings up the command creator menu
R TRIGGER:	TURN AROUND
START:		Brings up the game menu
SELECT:		Executes P L T, U L, P R SW (only good for getting started)

The command creator allows you to create all combinations of commands you will ever 
need (I hope I haven't missed any).  
ZSAVE and ZLOAD will use the default save file game.dod.
In the Command Creator Menu, X is select and CIRCLE is cancel.  If choosing an item, you can
press TRIANGLE to specify the type of item.

The keyboard lets you type in whatever command you want.

The game menu has a few extras in it just for the psp (and hopefully a few others to come).
You can now Save and Load the game from 10 different slots to give some variety for those 
that don't feel like typing in a save command.
In the Configure menu:
FULL SCREEN - does nothing
VIDEO MODE - allows you to change the resolution from the original size, to fit to height, 
or stretch to screen.
The rest has the regular functionality of the original game.

Currently the game is a bit slow using the original graphics mode.  I would recommend using 
the Vector mode.

Also I've only tested this on the PSP slim. If you find any bugs or suggestions, give me a 
message at darkwebcrypt at hotmail dot com or visit me at retroemu.com.

Hopefully you guys enjoy this wonderful game!
